# CS305
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company, they wanted their custom software to be looked over for any vulnerabilities.

It's important to code securely because if there is a breach, user's data is affected and so is their trust in the company. To ensure that 
a company keeps good relationships with their users, it's important to keep their data safe.

It was helpful to learn more about using maven, as well as using the NVD to read more information about what is shown as a "vulnerability".

After the code was refactored, I checked if anymore vulnerabilities were added by running the vulnerability check once again. 

Future employers could look at this work and see how i can use new tools/programs adeptly after a short time despite having no previous knowledge of them.
